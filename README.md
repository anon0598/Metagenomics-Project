# Metagenomics-Project
This repository contains all the scripts used throughout my BIOC0023 project.


1. Core Analysis: This folder contains all the relevant scripts for processing the raw data obtained from NGS using the 16S rRNA marker gene. This folder should be viewed first.

2. Statistical Tests: This folder contains scripts which were used to analyse data obtained following core analysis. 

3. Misc: This folder contains all miscellaneous scripts which did not fit into the above categories: includes generation of graphs, such as heatmap and PCoA plots as well as plots that were not used in the final report.
